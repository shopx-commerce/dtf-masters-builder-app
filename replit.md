# AnyNest App

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application (branded as AnyNest App) for creating customizable gangsheets and stickers from PNG images. Users can upload images, add white outlines, adjust stroke settings, resize images in inches, and download high-quality 300 DPI print-ready files. The application offers features like shape backgrounds, precise contour generation, and various download modes for professional printing and cutting.

### Key Features and Design Decisions
- **Image Processing Pipeline**: Drag-and-drop upload goes straight to design editor (no resize modal; auto-sizes to 3" on longest side), real-time canvas preview, customizable stroke (width, color, enable/disable), shape backgrounds (square, rectangle, circle, oval with fill colors and strokes), and high-resolution export.
- **Canvas Rendering**: Custom stroke algorithms using Clipper.js library for mathematically correct polygon offsetting, real-time preview, high-resolution export canvas.
- **Contour Generation**: True alpha channel edge detection, CadCut-style bounds detection, vector contour tracing using Clipper.js-based Minkowski sum offset with proper boundary tracing (Moore neighbor algorithm), support for interior holes with adjustable margins, single continuous outline generation for multi-object images, advanced alpha threshold control. Shape-aware contour: when an image is auto-detected as a geometric shape (circle, oval, square, rectangle), contour mode reuses the same perfect geometric outline instead of alpha tracing, ensuring consistent cut paths in both preview and PDF export. Uses `DetectedShapeInfo` (type + boundingBox) for precise centering based on actual content bounds; 256-point polygons for smooth circles/ovals.
- **Contour Mode System**: 2-mode algorithm selector (`ContourMode = 'smooth' | 'scattered'`). Smart auto-detection picks the best mode; users can override manually via UI buttons. UI labels: "Sharp" (internal key: smooth) = rounded corners for curved designs (default for most images), "Smooth" (internal key: scattered) = gap-bridging for multi-element designs with Chaikin smoothing. Auto-detection analyzes design complexity and scattered layout to choose the appropriate mode. Sharp mode includes composite shape fitting (`composite-shape-fit.ts`): detects if contour has a round body + rectangular tab, fits an ellipse to the body and a right-angle rectangle to the tab, then reconnects with clean tangent joins. Falls back to original traced contour if no composite pattern is detected.
- **Download System**: Multiple download modes (Standard, High-res, Vector Quality, CutContour), true vector export formats (PDF, EPS, SVG) with edge tracing, CutContour export with magenta spot color. PDF CutContour uses pathPoints (inch coordinates) converted to PDF points via ×72. Uses line segments with RDP simplification (epsilon=0.005 inches) for clean vector paths. Editable spot color label (CutContour/PerfCutContour/KissCut) stored as `cutContourLabel` state in image-editor.tsx, threaded through all PDF export functions via parameter.
- **Spot Color Vectors (RDG_WHITE/RDG_GLOSS)**: Users can tag extracted design colors as "White" or "Gloss" via checkboxes in the color list. Tagged colors are traced as vector regions (`spot-color-vectors.ts`): closest-color matching assigns each pixel to its nearest extracted color (tolerance 60, alpha threshold 240), boundaries are traced using **marching squares** algorithm that follows pixel grid edges for exact boundary fidelity — no smoothing, no simplification, no shape snapping. The marching squares enumerates all horizontal and vertical boundary edges between filled/unfilled pixels, chains them into closed contours using a right-turn priority rule (CW winding, filled region on right) for correct saddle-point disambiguation, then collapses collinear segments to reduce point count. All traced paths for a region are combined into a single compound PDF path using the even-odd fill rule (`f*` operator) so that inner boundaries (letter cutouts, holes) are properly subtracted from outer fills. Download buttons filter spot color flags by active mode (whitegloss vs fluorescent) to prevent ghost layers. Spot color names default to RDG_WHITE/RDG_GLOSS but are user-editable. Both `downloadContourPDF` and `downloadShapePDF` accept spot color data and call `addSpotColorVectorsToPDF` to write the layers. `singleArtboard` parameter controls whether spot color layers are added to the same page or separate pages. `SpotColorInput` type defined in `contour-outline.ts`, shared across all export files. Path ops use `cs`/`scn` (fill color space) with `f*` (even-odd fill) operator, magenta tint CMYK [0,1,0,0], wrapped in `q`/`Q` graphics state save/restore. **Web Worker**: All heavy computation (mask creation, marching squares tracing, collinear collapse, inch conversion) runs in a dedicated Web Worker (`spot-color-worker.ts`) at 300 DPI for zero UI lag. The main thread sends ImageData to the worker, receives traced regions back asynchronously. `addSpotColorVectorsToPDF` is now `async`.
- **Dual Contour System**: Users can lock the current contour via "Apply and Add.." button and generate a second contour with a different spot color label. Locked contour renders as blue (#3B82F6) dashed line in preview; active contour renders as magenta. PDF export creates separate Separation color spaces for each contour label. `LockedContour` type stores pathPoints, previewPathPoints, contourCanvasWidth/Height, and label. When both contours share the same label, the locked contour reuses the existing color space but still adds its path.
- **Multi-Design Artboard**: Multiple designs on one artboard with individual move/resize/rotate controls, duplicate/delete, design info panel. Two duplicate modes: plain "Duplicate" (places copy near original, no rearranging) and "Duplicate & Arrange" (duplicates N copies via quantity input and auto-arranges all). New uploads auto-arrange into the next available space on the artboard. Edge clamping prevents designs from leaving artboard bounds (accounts for rotation). Pixel-level overlap detection renders each design's alpha to offscreen canvas at 25% scale, compares alpha channels; overlapping designs get red bounding box and "Design OVERLAPPING" text. Click-to-select designs on artboard. Active design state (imageInfo, transform, resize dimensions) derived via `useMemo` from designs array + `selectedDesignId`—`handleSelectDesign` only sets ID, eliminating cascading state copies and lag. All callbacks (resize, download, background removal) use `selectedDesign?.imageInfo || imageInfo` pattern and sync changes back to designs array.
- **Preview Background Color**: Configurable artboard preview background (transparent/white/gray/black/magenta/cyan/custom color picker). Preview-only—does not affect downloads or exports. State: `previewBgColor` in preview-section.tsx.
- **2x DPI Preview Scaling**: Canvas renders at 2× CSS size (`DPI_SCALE = 2`) for sharper preview. All handle sizes, line widths, and hit-test radii scale by DPI_SCALE. `canvasToLocal` maps CSS→canvas coordinates correctly.
- **UI/UX**: Dark grey application theme, toast notifications, form validation, draggable and responsive controls, zoom functionality with "Fit to View", manual position control for design placement. Cursor feedback: nwse-resize for resize handles, custom rotate SVG cursor, move for drag, pointer for selectable designs.
- **Image Cropping**: Automatic empty space removal and content-aware cropping for precise boundary detection.
- **Design Logic**: Mutual exclusion between contour outline and shape background modes, dynamic UI controls for shape sizing, and automatic design clipping to prevent out-of-bounds rendering.
